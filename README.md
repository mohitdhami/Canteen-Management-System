# Canteen Management System
### Canteen Management System is a CLI-based application built using C++ that allows customers to purchase items from the canteen and provides management tools for the owner. The application utilizes a local database to store information.

## Customers Section
 
* Customers can purchase items from a pre-defined list of items by entering their serial number and quantity.  
*  After selecting all of the desired items, customers are prompted to enter their name into the system. 
* They are then directed to the checkout page, where they can review their purchase list and apply a coupon code for a 10-50% discount on their total amount.
* Finally, customers are taken to the invoice generation page, where they can clearly see their name, the time of purchase, and a tabular format of all items purchased with the final amount to be paid.

## Admin Section
 Before accessing the admin page, users must complete a verification step by entering a password to confirm that they are a valid admin. Once verified, the admin has access to two options:

### I. Customize Food Menu
1. Add New Item
( Exact Position, Beginning, Bottom)
2. Delete Item
3. Replace Item

### II. Check All the Sales he Made
The admin can view all sales made by the canteen and the overall revenue generated.</br>
